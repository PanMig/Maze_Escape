# OpenGL Game
This game was created in Opengl, with the aid of glut toolkit. It is a 3d game where the player jumps to a maze and must find a path that leeds out of the maze. This project was created during the graphics course in the university of Ioannina 
(Computer Science departement) by Panagiotis Migkotzidis and Spiros Rantoglou. The code has been tested and executed on Linux systems.

# Getting started
1) Download the source files

2) Complile your program using the following terminal command : g++ -o maze maze.cpp -lSOIL -lGLU -lglut -lGL

# How to play
